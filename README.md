* [Winfo](https://vidstromlabs.com/)
* [Systeminternals Suite](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals)

## DumpSec
security auditing program for Microsoft Windows. It dumps the permissions (DACLs) and audit settings (SACLs) for the file system, registry, printers and shares in a concise, readable format, so that holes in system security are readily apparent. DumpSec also dumps user, group and replication information.

## Winfo
Uses null sessions to remotely try to retrieve lists of and information about user accounts, workstation/interdomain/server trust accounts, shares (also hidden), sessions, logged in users, and password/lockout policy. It also identifies the built-in Administrator and Guest accounts, even if their names have been changed. 

## Systeminternals Suite
The Sysinternals Troubleshooting Utilities have been rolled up into a single Suite of tools. This file contains the individual troubleshooting tools and help files. It does not contain non-troubleshooting tools like the BSOD Screen Saver.
